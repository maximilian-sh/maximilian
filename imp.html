                <p>
                    As a service provider, we are responsible for our own content on these pages according to § 7 paragraph 1 TMG (German
                    Telemedia Act) and general laws. According to §§ 8 to 10 TMG, we are not obligated to monitor transmitted or stored
                    third-party information or to investigate circumstances that indicate illegal activity. Obligations to remove or block
                    the use of information under general law remain unaffected. However, liability in this regard is only possible from the
                    point in time at which a concrete infringement of the law becomes known. If we become aware of any such infringements,
                    we will remove the relevant content immediately.

                <p>
                    Our offer contains links to external websites of third parties, on whose contents we have no influence. Therefore, we
                    cannot assume any liability for these external contents. The respective provider or operator of the pages is always
                    responsible for the contents of the linked pages. The linked pages were checked for possible legal violations at the
                    time of linking. Illegal contents were not recognizable at the time of linking. However, a permanent control of the
                    contents of the linked pages is not reasonable without concrete evidence of a violation of the law. If we become aware
                    of any infringements, we will remove such links immediately.
